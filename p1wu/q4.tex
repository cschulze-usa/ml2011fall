The top and bottom five had weights with the same values so we extended the list from 5 to 7 for the positiv values.
We did the same thing for the negative ones where we extended the list from 5 to 6.

Below you can see the top and bottom weights and their corresponding classes.

There were two things that were interesting in these weights:
 - no other course from the AI area had a high or low weight associated with it.
 - there is a clustering of undergrad courses in the negative weights (introduction to c programmin, object-oriented programming i+ii)

Besides that there seemed to be no reason for choosing these weights that we could think of. The positiv weights seem to be randomly drawn from the other categories (besides AI).
